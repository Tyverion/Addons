FastCS   - I've adjusted this to only enable post menu selection. So we're not trying to select a menu option at a billion fps.

rnpc     - This is a multibox tool that when loaded on all of your characters. 
          And if any of your characters can't see an entity find one that can and use //rnpc while targeting the entity (i.e. Maws). 
          This will force the NPC update request.
      
muffins  - Tracks gained muffins for a sortie run.

Debuffed - Added several debuff tracking. 

Recast   - This is basically timers but draggable and if you are a multiboxer you can track your other char's cooldowns.
